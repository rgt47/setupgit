# Introduction



Version Control for biostatistics/data-science data analysis is the challenge.
There are multiple systems to choose from.  We'll discuss how to get started with
git in this post. 

Lets take it one step at a time.

Scenario 1: We have a `git` user `@rgt47` has been working on a data analysis
for some data from the public alzheimers disease data repository, ADNI. Its
moderately complex and uses lots of packages. He's ready to ask his team to join
the analysis process. What are the first steps he should take to do that? 

Step 1. Start by adding the first team member with a `github` username
`@rgt4748` to the project. 


Step 2.  User rgt47 should log into `Github` and navigating to the repository to
be shared, say `x24`. Select `settings` (in top row of tabs) and then the
`collaborators` tab (in the left panel)

Select green "add people" button on the right side of the page, then "invite
collaborator", then use the search box   in the center of the page to locate
user `rgt4748`. Lastly select "Add rgt4748". 

```{r }
#...............................................................................
#                                                                              .
#  got this far. All edits made. 8/20/24                                       .
#                                                                              .
#...............................................................................
```
Step 3.  rgt4748 should login and accept invitation: 

click "message" icon in upper right corner.

Select "Invitation to join rgt47/x23 from rgt47", then "Accept Invitation" green
button in center of page. 

They'll be taken to the `rgt47/x24` repo. 

Now on their workstation they can clone repository  with the following code:

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/rgt4748/x24.git
```
```sh
> cd x24
> git branch myedits
> git checkout myedits
> vim x24.Rmd
```
modify `title: "R2"` to `title: "changed R2"` and save edits. 
```sh
> git add .
> git commit -m "sample edit"
> git push origin myedits #(?)
> git checkout master
> git merge myedits
> git branch -d myedits #(delete branch)
```

Click `contribute` button, then `open pull request`, `create pull request`,
enter `title` and `description`. 

login as rgt47. you'll see one notification. check `files changed`

# Appendix.  GIT for nitwits

git init

git add fname

git status #see what happens on commit
git commit -am “commit message”

git push

git branch work

git checkout work

… make changes …
git add *
git commit -m “something”

git checkout master

git merge work

git branch -d work

git log   #see all commits

git checkout HASH    #Restore old branch


Consider editing ./.git/config


View file in master branch.
git show master:a101.Rmd | mvim -

Copy file from other branch (master)
git checkout master uw.png

Rule 6: Use the Imperative mood

A valuable practice involves crafting commit messages with the
underlying understanding that the commit, when implemented, will achieve
a precise action. Construct your commit message in a manner that
logically completes the sentence “If applied, this commit will…”. For
instance, rather than,git commit -m "Fixed the bug on the layout page"
. use this git commit -m "Fix the bug on the layout page" ✔

In other words, if this commit were to be applied, it would indeed fix
the bug on the layout page.

Rule 7: Explain “What” and “Why”, but not “How”.

Limiting commit messages to “what” and “why” creates concise yet
informative explanations of each change. Developers seeking “How” the
code was implemented can refer directly to the codebase. Instead,
highlight what was altered and the rationale for the change, including
which component or area was affected.

Case Study: Angular’s Commit Message Practices

Angular stands as a prominent illustration of effective commit messaging
practices. The Angular team advocates for the use of specific prefixes
when crafting commit messages. These prefixes include “chore: ,” “docs:
,” “style: ,” “feat: ,” “fix: ,” “refactor: ,” and “test: .” By
incorporating these prefixes, the commit history becomes a valuable
resource for understanding the nature of each commit.  Tips

Remember to prioritize clear and meaningful communication through your
commit messages. A well-crafted commit message serves as a story that
explains ‘what,’ ‘why,’ but not ‘how’ a change was made. Remember, your
commit history is a collaborative resource that future you and your team
will rely on. Make it a habit to create commit messages that stand as
informative, concise, and consistent narratives.
